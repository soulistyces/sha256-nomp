# SHA256-NOMP - Node Open Mining Portal

[![License: GPL v2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v2-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)

This is a SHA256 mining pool with solo mining support and ASICBoost with version rolling, based on Node Open Mining Portal.

#### Production Usage Notice

This is beta software. All of the following are things that can change and break an existing SHA256-NOMP setup: functionality of any feature, structure of configuration files and structure of redis data. If you use this software in production then _DO NOT_ pull new code straight into production usage because it can and often will break your setup and require you to tweak things like config files or redis data. _Only tagged releases are considered stable._

#### Paid Solution

Usage of this software requires abilities with sysadmin, database admin, coin daemons, and sometimes a bit of programming. Running a production pool can literally be more work than a full-time job.

### Features

- ✅ **Solo Mining Support** - Miners can mine solo with `m=solo` password parameter
- ✅ **ASICBoost Support** - Full support with version rolling for mining optimization
- ✅ **Multi-Version Support** - `mining.multi_version` extension for overt AsicBoost
- ✅ **Fixed Payment System** - Resolved double fee deduction issue (v1.4.1)
- ✅ **Multiple Payment Modes** - PROP and PPLNT payment systems
- ✅ **Dual Mining** - Support pool and solo mining simultaneously
- ✅ **Admin Center** - Web-based administration panel with secure bcrypt authentication

### Recent Updates (v1.4.7)

- **NEW**: Optional miner-configurable variable difficulty (`tt=`/`rt=`/`vp=` password params) — lets experienced miners tune their own retarget timing within operator-defined bounds, per port, off by default
- **IMPROVED**: Getting Started page documents the new tuning parameters, with a clear "most miners don't need this" framing for casual users

### Recent Updates (v1.4.6)

- **FIXED**: Coinbase transaction framing bug that corrupted the block's merkle root when `txMessages` was enabled — pool signature is now embedded as a standards-compliant OP_RETURN output instead of invalid trailing bytes
- **FIXED**: `blockIdentifier` was written to shared global state, leaking one coin's identifier into every other coin's mined blocks when running multiple coins in the same process — now threaded per-coin end to end, with a byte-length safety cap
- **FIXED**: `md=` (minimum difficulty) password parameter now correctly floors the miner's assigned difficulty instead of being silently ignored
- **FIXED**: Immature balance display showed raw satoshis instead of coins due to a missing unit conversion in the payment processor
- **NEW**: Security module bans (rate limiting, malformed messages, flood detection) now actually block reconnection attempts, instead of being logged without being enforced
- **NEW**: Worker cards on the website now show Last Share (time + actual difficulty) and Best Share (highest difficulty this round)
- **NEW**: Log archives are compacted into one monthly archive instead of being deleted after 30 days
- **IMPROVED**: Graceful shutdown handling — `systemctl restart` no longer races with worker auto-respawn logic

### Recent Updates (v1.4.5)

- **NEW**: Added `mining.multi_version` stratum extension for overt AsicBoost
- **NEW**: Admin Center with secure bcrypt password hashing
- **IMPROVED**: Enhanced stratum protocol handling

### Recent Updates (v1.4.4)

- **UPDATE**: Security enhancements
- **Fixed**: Memory optimization

### Recent Updates (v1.4.3)

- **UPDATE**: Added Whatsminer support

### Recent Updates (v1.4.2)

- **UPDATE**: Updated package.json dependencies
- **FIXED**: Logging and added log rotation, log archive

### Recent Updates (v1.4.1)

- **FIXED**: Double fee deduction bug in solo mining payment processing
- **IMPROVED**: Solo mining fees now correctly compensate for coinbase rewardRecipients
- **ENHANCED**: Consistent fee handling for both 'generate' and 'immature' blocks
- **OPTIMIZED**: Payment processor efficiency improvements

# Usage

#### Requirements

- Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source or use the already built ones)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v16+ ([follow these installation instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager))
- [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ ([follow these instructions](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))

##### Seriously

Those are legitimate requirements. If you use old versions of Node.js or Redis that may come with your system package manager then you will have problems. Follow the linked instructions to get the last stable versions.

[**Redis security warning**](http://redis.io/topics/security): be sure firewall access to redis - an easy way is to
include `bind 127.0.0.1` in your `redis.conf` file. Also it's a good idea to learn about and understand software that
you are using - a good place to start with redis is [data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence).

#### 0) Setting up coin daemon

Follow the build/install instructions for your coin daemon. Your coin.conf file should end up looking something like this:

```
daemon=1
rpcuser=username
rpcpassword=password
rpcport=8332
```

For redundancy, its recommended to have at least two daemon instances running in case one drops out-of-sync or offline,
all instances will be polled for block/transaction updates and be used for submitting blocks. Creating a backup daemon
involves spawning a daemon using the `-datadir=/backup` command-line argument which creates a new daemon instance with
it's own config directory and coin.conf file. Learn about the daemon, how to use it and how it works if you want to be
a good pool operator. For starters be sure to read:

- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_bitcoind
- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory
- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list
- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty

#### 1) Downloading & Installing

Clone the repository and run `npm install` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsodium-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp3-dev node-gyp libssl-dev -y
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
sudo npm install n -g
sudo n stable
sudo apt purge nodejs npm -y
git clone https://github.com/janos-raul/sha256-nomp
cd sha256-nomp
npm install
```

#### 2) Configuration

SHA256-NOMP uses three types of configuration files:

- **config.json** - Main portal configuration
- **coins/\*.json** - Coin-specific configurations (blockchain settings)
- **pool_configs/\*.json** - Pool operational configurations (ports, fees, payments)

##### Portal config

Inside the `config_example.json` file, ensure the default configuration will work for your environment, then copy the file to `config.json`.

##### Coin config

Inside the `coins` directory, ensure a json file exists for your coin. The coin configuration defines blockchain-specific settings and daemon connection parameters.

**Available Coins:**

- `bitcoin.json` - Bitcoin (BTC)
- `bitcoinsilver.json` - Bitcoin Silver (BTCS)
- `bitcoingold.json` - Bitcoin Gold (BTGS)

{
    // Basic coin information
    "name": "bitcoin",
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "reward": "POW",

    // ASICBoost configuration
    "asicboost": true,                    // Enable ASICBoost with version rolling
    "versionMask": "0x3fffe000",          // Version mask for ASICBoost

        "enabled": false,                  // Master switch for coinbase payout controls
        "coinbaseOnly": false,             // If true, payment txs spend only generated (coinbase) UTXOs
        "feeHandledInCoinbase": false      // If true, payment processor will NOT deduct poolFee/soloFee again
    },
    "txMessages": true,                     // Enable the pool signature OP_RETURN output in the coinbase tx
    "txMessageText": "",                    // Custom OP_RETURN message text (max 255 bytes, truncated if longer).
                                            // Falls back to a built-in default URL if left empty.
    "segwit": true,                         // Enable SegWit support
    "default_witness_commitment": true,     // Informational only — the witness commitment output is included
                                            // automatically whenever the daemon's getblocktemplate response
                                            // provides one; this flag is not read anywhere and does not gate it.

    // Network and timing settings
    "blockTime": 600,                       // Expected block time in seconds — used for luck (luckDays/
                                            // luckHours/luckMinute) calculations shown on the website
    "minConf": 101,                         // Informational/reference only. The value that actually gates
                                            // payouts is pool_configs/<coin>.json -> paymentProcessing.minConf
                                            // — keep the two in sync manually, since nothing enforces it.

    // Address validation (prevents invalid addresses)
    "addressValidation": {
        "validateWorkerUsername": true,   // Validate miner addresses
        "addressPrefix": "bc1",           // Expected address prefix (bc for BTC, bs for BTCS, myt for MYT)
        "minLength": 26,                  // Minimum address length
        "maxLength": 46                   // Maximum address length
    },

    // Block explorer URLs
    "explorer": {
        "txURL": "https://blockstream.info/tx/",        // Transaction explorer URL
        "blockURL": "https://blockstream.info/block/"   // Block explorer URL
    },

    // RPC daemon connection (used by blockConfirmations.js and other utilities)
    "rpc": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",              // Daemon host
        "port": 8332,                     // Daemon RPC port
        "user": "rpcuser",                // RPC username
        "password": "rpcpassword"         // RPC password
    }
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- The value that actually gates payouts is `pool_configs/<coin>.json` -> `paymentProcessing.minConf` — the coin config's own `minConf` is a reference/documentation copy only and isn't read by the payment processor
- Bitcoin typically uses 101 confirmations, Bitcoin Silver uses 201
- ASICBoost is enabled by default for optimal performance with modern ASIC miners
- The `rpc` section is used by maintenance scripts like `blockConfirmations.js`

##### Pool config

Pool configurations define operational settings for each coin's mining pool. Each coin has its own pool config file in `pool_configs/`.

**Available Pool Configurations:**

- `pool_configs/bitcoin.json` - Bitcoin pool (ports 50212-50216)
- `pool_configs/bitcoinsilver.json` - Bitcoin Silver pool (ports 50222-50226)
- `pool_configs/bitcoingold.json` - Bitcoin Gold pool ports (50292-50296)
- `pool_configs/mytherra.json` - Mytherra pool (ports 50232-50236)
- `pool_configs/bitcoinii.json` - Bitcoin II pool (ports 50242-50246)
- `pool_configs/sha256coin.json` - SHA256COIN pool (ports 50272-50276)

**Pool Configuration Structure:**

    "blockIdentifier": "",                  // Text embedded in the coinbase scriptSig, wrapped in slashes
                                            // (e.g. "mypool.com" -> "/mypool.com/"). Passed per-coin all the
                                            // way through to the built transaction — safe to set differently
                                            // per coin. Falls back to a built-in default if left empty.
                                            // Truncated at 64 bytes to stay within the scriptSig's 100-byte

**Difficulty Notes:**

> **Important:** Pool difficulty is NOT the same as network difficulty!
>
> - 1.0 pool difficulty = 8192 network difficulty
> - 0.125 pool difficulty = 1024 network difficulty
>
> When miners submit shares, the pool accumulates the difficulty:
>
> - Miner 1 at 0.1 difficulty finding 10 shares = 1 accumulated share
> - Miner 2 at 0.5 difficulty finding 5 shares = 2.5 accumulated shares

**Payment Modes:**

- **PROP (Proportional)**: Miners are paid proportionally to their shares when a block is found
- **PPLNT (Pay Per Last N Time)**: Payment based on shares in the last N time window

**Port Configuration Strategy:**
Each coin has multiple ports with different difficulty ranges:

- Low difficulty ports (e.g., 50212): For small miners and testing
- Medium difficulty ports (e.g., 50213): For medium-sized miners
- High difficulty ports (e.g., 50214): For large mining operations
- Very high difficulty ports (e.g., 50216): For massive mining farms

**Fee Structure - IMPORTANT:**

Understanding how fees work is crucial for proper pool operation:

1. **rewardRecipients** (Coinbase-level split):
   - Deducted directly from block reward at coinbase transaction creation
   - Happens BEFORE any other fee calculations
   - Example with 6.25 BTC block and 1.0% rewardRecipients:
     - 0.0625 BTC goes to fee address immediately
     - Remaining 6.1875 BTC available for pool/solo fee calculations
   - **CAUTION**: Using this complicates fee accounting!
   - **RECOMMENDED**: Set to 0.0 and use poolFee/soloFee instead

2. **poolFee** (Pool mining fee):
   - Applied to pool miners AFTER rewardRecipients deduction
   - Percentage taken from remaining block reward
   - Simple and transparent for miners
   - Example with 2.0% poolFee on 6.25 BTC block (no rewardRecipients):
     - Pool takes: 0.125 BTC
     - Miners share: 6.125 BTC

3. **soloFee** (Solo mining fee):
   - Applied to solo miners AFTER rewardRecipients deduction
   - Solo miner receives entire block minus this fee
   - Example with 2.0% soloFee on 6.25 BTC block (no rewardRecipients):
     - Pool takes: 0.125 BTC
     - Solo miner receives: 6.125 BTC

**Best Practice Fee Configuration:**

```javascript
"rewardRecipients": {
    "YOUR_FEE_ADDRESS": 0.0   // Keep at 0.0 for simplicity
},
"paymentProcessing": {
    "poolFee": 2.0,           // Your pool fee percentage
    "soloFee": 2.0            // Your solo mining fee percentage
}
```

This approach keeps accounting simple and transparent for your miners.

**Coinbase Payouts (`coinbasePayouts`) Explained:**

`coinbasePayouts` is configured in `coins/*.json` and controls how payout funding and fee accounting are handled.

1. `enabled`
   - Enables coinbase payout logic for that coin.
   - When `false`, payout behavior is standard (no coinbase-only UTXO restrictions, normal fee deduction behavior).

2. `coinbaseOnly`
   - When `true`, payout transactions are funded only from generated coinbase UTXOs.
   - Non-coinbase UTXOs are excluded from payout funding.
   - Use this only if you explicitly want strict separation between mined rewards and other wallet funds.

3. `feeHandledInCoinbase`
   - When `true`, the payment processor does not deduct `poolFee`/`soloFee` again.
   - This prevents double charging if your fee is already handled at coinbase level (for example through `rewardRecipients`).
   - When `false`, `poolFee`/`soloFee` are deducted normally during payment processing.

**Recommended Config Patterns:**

1. Standard/simple pool setup (recommended)

```javascript
// coins/yourcoin.json
"coinbasePayouts": {
    "enabled": false,
    "coinbaseOnly": false,
    "feeHandledInCoinbase": false
}

// pool_configs/yourcoin.json
"rewardRecipients": {
    "YOUR_FEE_ADDRESS": 0.0
},
"paymentProcessing": {
    "poolFee": 2.0,
    "soloFee": 2.0
}
```

2. Coinbase-fee setup (advanced)

```javascript
// coins/yourcoin.json
"coinbasePayouts": {
    "enabled": true,
    "coinbaseOnly": false,
    "feeHandledInCoinbase": true
}

// pool_configs/yourcoin.json
"rewardRecipients": {
    "YOUR_FEE_ADDRESS": 1.0
},
"paymentProcessing": {
    "poolFee": 0.0,
    "soloFee": 0.0
}
```

Use this advanced mode only if you intentionally want fee collection to happen in coinbase outputs instead of payment-time deductions.

**Migration Note (From Mixed Config to Clean Mode):**

If your current config mixes `rewardRecipients` with non-zero `poolFee`/`soloFee`, move to one of these clean modes to avoid fee confusion.

1. Migrate to standard payment-fee mode (recommended)
   - Set `coins/*.json -> coinbasePayouts.enabled = false`
   - Set `coins/*.json -> coinbasePayouts.feeHandledInCoinbase = false`
   - Set `pool_configs/*.json -> rewardRecipients` percentages to `0.0`
   - Keep your desired `paymentProcessing.poolFee` and `paymentProcessing.soloFee`

2. Migrate to coinbase-fee mode (advanced)
   - Set `coins/*.json -> coinbasePayouts.enabled = true`
   - Set `coins/*.json -> coinbasePayouts.feeHandledInCoinbase = true`
   - Set fee percentages in `pool_configs/*.json -> rewardRecipients`
   - Set `paymentProcessing.poolFee = 0.0` and `paymentProcessing.soloFee = 0.0`

3. Optional strict-funding rule
   - Set `coinbasePayouts.coinbaseOnly = true` only if you want payouts funded strictly from mined coinbase UTXOs.

4. Verification checklist after migration
   - Confirm one and only one fee path is active.
   - Run one payment cycle and verify expected fee amounts.
   - Confirm no unexpected second fee deduction in logs and payout totals.

#### Solo Mining Configuration

Miners connect for solo mining using the password parameter:

```
Username: YOUR_BITCOIN_ADDRESS
Password: m=solo
```

Example connections:

- **CGMiner**: `cgminer -o stratum+tcp://yourpool.com:3032 -u YOUR_ADDRESS -p m=solo`
- **With custom difficulty**: `cgminer -o stratum+tcp://yourpool.com:3032 -u YOUR_ADDRESS -p m=solo,d=65536`

#### Password Parameters

Miners can pass one or more of the following via the stratum password field, comma-separated:

| Parameter    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `m=solo`     | Mine solo instead of pool mode                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `d=<value>`  | Set the miner's _starting_ difficulty immediately on connect, overriding the port's configured default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `md=<value>` | Set a _minimum_ difficulty floor — variable difficulty will retarget freely above this value but will never drop the miner below it, even if their share timing suggests it should. Useful for large ASICs (S19/S21/T21-class) to reduce unnecessary share traffic. The floor is clamped between the port's own `minDiff` and `maxDiff`, so it can raise the effective floor but can never push it above the port's configured ceiling. |
| `tt=<value>` | Requested varDiff target time (seconds between shares). Only takes effect on ports with `minerConfigurable.targetTime` set; clamped to that range. Ignored (falls back to the port default) otherwise. |
| `rt=<value>` | Requested varDiff retarget time (seconds between adjustments). Only takes effect on ports with `minerConfigurable.retargetTime` set; clamped to that range. Ignored otherwise. |
| `vp=<value>` | Requested varDiff variance percent. Only takes effect on ports with `minerConfigurable.variancePercent` set; clamped to that range. Ignored otherwise. |

Example: `-p m=solo,d=1000000,md=500000` starts the miner at difficulty 1,000,000 and guarantees it never retargets below 500,000.

#### Miner-Configurable VarDiff (tt=/rt=/vp=)

For experienced miners who know their own hashrate, a port can optionally let miners tune how their own
variable difficulty behaves, instead of only using the operator's fixed per-port settings. This is
**off by default** — a port only accepts `tt=`/`rt=`/`vp=` if its config explicitly includes a
`varDiff.minerConfigurable` block (see the `50212` example under [Pool config](#pool-config) above).

How it behaves:

- **Disabled ports ignore the parameters silently.** No error, no rejection — the connection proceeds
  normally using the port's own defaults, exactly as if the miner hadn't sent them.
- **Values are always clamped**, never rejected outright. A request outside the operator's configured
  `min`/`max` range is silently adjusted to the nearest allowed value rather than causing a connection
  failure — there's no way for a miner to misconfigure this into something harmful to the pool.
- **Settings are locked in at the miner's first submitted share** and apply for the rest of that
  connection's session; reconnecting re-evaluates them from the current password.
- Each of the three settings (`targetTime`, `retargetTime`, `variancePercent`) can be enabled
  independently — a port can allow miner-configurable `targetTime` while keeping `retargetTime` and
  `variancePercent` operator-only, for example.

Example: `-p m=solo,tt=30,rt=180,vp=20` requests a 30-second target time between shares, retargeting
every 180 seconds, with 20% variance tolerance — each only honored if that port's config allows it.

#### Multi-Version Support (mining.multi_version)

SHA256-NOMP supports the `mining.multi_version` stratum extension for overt AsicBoost mining. This is an alternative to `mining.configure` version rolling.

##### Enabling Multi-Version

Add the `multiVersion` configuration to your coin config (`coins/*.json`):

```javascript
{
    "name": "bitcoin",
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    // ... other settings ...

    "multiVersion": {
        "enabled": true,                    // Enable mining.multi_version support
        "maxVersions": 4,                   // Maximum versions a miner can request (1-16)
        "generationMode": "sequential"      // Version generation mode
    }
}
```

##### How It Works

1. Miner sends: `{"method": "mining.multi_version", "params": [4]}`
2. Pool responds with `result: true` if enabled
3. Pool sends jobs with multiple versions in `mining.notify`
4. Miner can use any of the provided versions for share submission

##### Miner Compatibility

Miners supporting `mining.multi_version`:

- Custom firmware with multi_version support
- Some Bitmain firmware variants
- Mining proxies with multi_version capability

---

#### Admin Center

SHA256-NOMP includes a web-based administration panel for managing your pool. Access it at `http://yourpool.com/admin`.

##### Features

- View and manage active pools
- Monitor pool statistics
- Add/modify pool configurations
- Secure bcrypt password authentication

##### Setting Up Admin Center

**Step 1: Generate a Password Hash**

For security, admin passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes, not plain text. Use the included tool to generate your hash:

```bash
cd nomp-password
node generate-password-hash.js
```

The tool will:

1. Prompt you to enter your desired password
2. Generate a secure bcrypt hash
3. Show you the hash to use in your config

Example output:

```
================================================================================
SHA256-NOMP Admin Password Hash Generator
================================================================================

Enter your desired admin password: ********

Generating bcrypt hash (this may take a moment)...

================================================================================
Password Hash Generated Successfully!
================================================================================

Your bcrypt hash is:

  $2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMy.MqrqvZjCn4Y5XpLz8DJDm7X8NlZPvDK

================================================================================
```

**Step 2: Configure config.json**

Add the hash to your `config.json`:

```javascript
"website": {
    "enabled": true,
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 80,
    "stratumHost": "yourpool.com",
    "stats": {
        "updateInterval": 15,
        "historicalRetention": 43200,
        "hashrateWindow": 300
    },
    "adminCenter": {
        "enabled": true,
        "passwordHash": "$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMy.MqrqvZjCn4Y5XpLz8DJDm7X8NlZPvDK"
    }
}
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Use `"passwordHash"` (not `"password"`) to enable secure bcrypt authentication.

**Step 3: Access Admin Panel**

1. Navigate to `http://yourpool.com/admin`
2. Enter your original password (not the hash!)
3. Optionally check "Stay Logged In" to save session

##### Security Notes

- **Never share your password hash publicly** (though it's much safer than plain text)
- Use a strong password (20+ characters recommended)
- Each hash generation produces a different result (this is normal and secure)
- If you forget your password, simply generate a new hash
- The admin panel uses cookies for session management
- For production, always use HTTPS to protect credentials in transit

##### Legacy Plain Text Password (Not Recommended)

For backwards compatibility, you can still use plain text passwords:

```javascript
"adminCenter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "password": "your-plain-text-password"  // NOT RECOMMENDED
}
```

> **WARNING:** Plain text passwords are stored in your config file and could be exposed. Always use `passwordHash` for production deployments.

---

##### [Optional, recommended] Setting up blocknotify

1. In `config.json` set the port and password for `blockNotifyListener`
2. In your daemon conf file set the `blocknotify` command to use:

```
node [path to cli.js] [coin name in config] [block hash symbol]
```

Example: inside `bitcoin.conf` add the line

```
blocknotify=node /home/user/sha256-nomp/scripts/cli.js blocknotify bitcoin %s
```

Alternatively, you can use a more efficient block notify script written in pure C. Build and usage instructions
are commented in [scripts/blocknotify.c](scripts/blocknotify.c).

#### 3) Block Confirmation Monitoring

SHA256-NOMP includes a utility script for monitoring block confirmations: `libs/blockConfirmations.js`

##### What is blockConfirmations.js?

This script checks the confirmation status of pending blocks (both pool and solo) and updates their status in Redis. It's useful for:

- Monitoring block maturity before payouts
- Detecting orphaned blocks
- Tracking confirmation progress
- Debugging payment issues

##### How blockConfirmations.js Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Connects to Redis** - Reads pending blocks from the pool's Redis database
2. **Queries Coin Daemons** - Checks each pending block against the blockchain via RPC
3. **Updates Confirmations** - Records the current confirmation count for each block
4. **Detects Orphans** - Identifies blocks that are no longer in the main chain
5. **Generates Report** - Provides detailed statistics about block status

##### Using blockConfirmations.js - Step by Step

**Step 1: Configure the Script**

Edit `libs/blockConfirmations.js` and update the `poolConfigs` object with your coin configurations:

```javascript
const poolConfigs = {
  bitcoin: {
    daemon: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 8332,
      user: "rpcuser",
      password: "rpcpassword",
    },
    minConfirmations: 101, // Must match your pool config minConf
  },
  bitcoinsilver: {
    daemon: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 10013,
      user: "rpcuser",
      password: "rpcpassword",
    },
    minConfirmations: 201,
  },
  // Add more coins as needed
};
```

**Step 2: Ensure Redis is Running**

The script requires Redis to be running and accessible:

```bash
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

**Step 3: Run the Script**

Execute the script from the pool's root directory:

```bash
node libs/blockConfirmations.js
```

**Step 4: Interpret the Output**

The script provides detailed output:

```
[SPECIAL] [BlockConfirm] [Init] === Block Confirmation Tracker Started ===
[INFO] [BlockConfirm] [Init] Checking confirmations for: bitcoin, bitcoinsilver, mytherra
[INFO] [BlockConfirm] [bitcoin] Starting block confirmation check...

[INFO] [BlockConfirm] [Summary] Solo blocks: 1 (Confirmed: 1)
[WARNING] [BlockConfirm] [Summary] Orphaned blocks detected: 1
```

**Step 5: Automate with Cron (Optional)**

For regular monitoring, add to your crontab:

```bash
# Check block confirmations every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * cd /path/to/sha256-nomp && /usr/bin/node libs/blockConfirmations.js >> logs/block-confirmations.log 2>&1
```

##### Understanding Block Confirmations

**What are confirmations?**

- Each new block added to the blockchain after your block counts as one confirmation
- Confirmations make blocks more secure and less likely to be orphaned
- Most pools require 101-201 confirmations before paying out miners

**Block States:**

- **Pending**: Block found but not yet confirmed (0 - minConf confirmations)
- **Confirmed**: Block has reached required confirmations (≥ minConf)
- **Orphaned**: Block no longer in the main chain (confirmations = -1)

**Why blocks get orphaned:**

- Another miner found a competing block at the same height
- Network propagation delays
- Chain reorganizations

**Confirmation Requirements by Coin:**

- Bitcoin (BTC): 101 confirmations (~16.8 hours)
- Bitcoin Silver (BTCS): 201 confirmations (~16.8 hours, 5 min blocks)
- Mytherra (MYT): 101 confirmations (~8.4 hours, 5 min blocks)
- Bitcoin II (BC2): 101 confirmations (~16.8 hours)

##### Troubleshooting

**Script can't connect to Redis:**

```bash
# Check if Redis is running
sudo systemctl status redis

# Start Redis if needed
sudo systemctl start redis
```

**RPC connection errors:**

- Verify daemon is running and synced
- Check RPC credentials in blockConfirmations.js
- Ensure firewall allows RPC connections
- Verify RPC port is correct for each coin

**No pending blocks found:**

- Normal if no recent blocks were found
- Check that pool has been running and miners are connected
- Verify Redis contains block data: `redis-cli keys "*blocksPending*"`

#### 4) Start the portal

```bash
npm start
```

###### Optional enhancements for your awesome new mining pool server setup:

- Use something like [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to keep the node script running
  in case the master process crashes.
- Use something like [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander) to have a nice GUI
  for exploring your redis database.
- Use something like [logrotator](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/logrotate-examples/) to rotate log
  output from SHA256-NOMP.
- Use [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) to monitor your SHA256-NOMP instance and server performance.

#### Upgrading SHA256-NOMP

When updating SHA256-NOMP to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update
the `node-stratum-pool` and `node-multi-hashing` modules, and any config files that may have been changed.

- Inside your SHA256-NOMP directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest SHA256-NOMP code.
- Remove the dependencies by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
- Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
- Compare your `config.json` and `pool_configs/coin.json` configurations to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. <b>You may need to modify or add any new changes.</b>
